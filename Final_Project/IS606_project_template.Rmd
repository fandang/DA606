### Part 1 - Introduction:

Campaign contributions can teach us a lot about our candidates that the debates and media may not.  Some of these questions are:

* Who are the donors?
* Who received the largest donations?
* What is the mean and median size of the donation?
* What donation patterns do we see across the political spectrum?
* When in the campaign timeframe are the donations made?
* Are there patterns in the size and donor based upon where the candidate falls on the political spectrum?
